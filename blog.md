# Can I clone a game in 2 days time? given the community and the opensource

As you can see from the title, this is an experiment. I don't know whether this
would be pulled off or not. I heard about the GrowInCommunity x Showwcase
blogathon on June 28, 2023. So, I wanted to post something also. After some 
thought, I decided to clone a game I stumbled upon. The game is simple but
immersive.


Official Playstore link to the game: 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nixgames.reaction&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1

*Note*: It is no intend of mine to pirate/clean-room reverse engineer the game.
Just a genuine replica of the game I enjoyed. The canonical product is light-years
better than my rip-off. Give it a try. This is not an affiliation.

## Plan of Attack

I plan not to replicate the entire game as the original is designed mobile in 
mind; Thus, I will try to replicate the levels that can be ported to the desktop
or laptop version. Few of such levels I plan to replicate:
    - the color change
    - recognize the number
    - physical button: color change, but for keyboard
    - number in order: type numbers in shown order
    - sound: reaction to a sound 
    - find color

I may/may-not be able to complete the game clone. That's the point. I wanted to 
see can I speed up my dev flow given the community around the web. Well it is 
obvious the community is great, but I might not be able to steer through; the 
aim is to can someone noob(like me) do this?

## Video

I compiled a video for vlog-lovers. Enjoy! Excuse my amatuer editing.

## The Design Phase

First I would just like to create a minimal viable product. So, I went on with 
a pastel palette from Cooolers. For the time being, this is enough, I presume.
The original however is black&white, my last edition would be the same.

## Lessons learned

Please refer the project's README.md for the time being.
